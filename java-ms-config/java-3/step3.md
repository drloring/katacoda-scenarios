Next, we're going to deploy a clustered redis database to kubernetes.  But first, we'll need Helm 3 again.

Install helm from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3`

Install the `bitnami/redis` chart from a locally installed helm repo.

Run docker to build your image, and install it with helm.
