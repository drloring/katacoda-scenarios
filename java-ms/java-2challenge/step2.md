`wget` or `curl` the previously build service jar file from here `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drloring/katacoda-resources/main/rest-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

Now add the copy command to the Dockerfile to copy the local jar file to the container (call it svc.jar in the 
container) and save the Dockerfile.
