In this challenge, we're going to take the web service we created in the previous lesson and package it into a Docker image.  If you don't recall, or haven't taken the prior course, please see this [link](https://katacoda.com/ng-dloring/courses/java-ms/java-2) to visit that course. 

But first, start by creating a Dockerfile with the touch command and editing the file to include our base layer `FROM openjdk:11`.
